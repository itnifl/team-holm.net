<plaintext>   One day when the pcs are on theyir way to Verge, they will meet
   a horse on the way walking in the opposide direction.
   On the horse there lies a man. He really looks dead. 
   The horse is white and walks slowly. When the pcs come closer
   to the horse and the man, they see that the man is dead. He is white 
   and and abit blue here and there in the face. They can see that he 
   has been dead a while. When the horse and the man on it has reached
   them, the man falls of his horse and on the ground like a bag. 
   He has deep cuts in his stummick, surely after a fight.
   The man weares studded leather, riding boots, pands, and a baldric
   without a sword. The horse is allso hurt with a deep cut over his
   left side. The horse is ofcourse saddled. The man is allso carrying 
   a belt pouch, large. In the belt pouch there are 5 silver coins(sp).
   If the pcs look around in the area they wont find anything. Neither 
   will they find anything else on the dead man than I havre 
   allready told. This should happen 2 hours from Verge(walking.
   Either the pcs choose to turn and head back or they continue theyr
   journey to Verge they will be attacked by a group of soldiers.
   These soldiers belong to a man named Dmitri Alesandrof. The dead man on 
   the horse was one of the Barons men in Verge. (But only the DM knows that). 
   He got attacked with some other soldiers when they got attacked by Dmitris men. 
   Dmitri is thinking to attack Verge and steel a book which belongs to 
   the Baron of Verge. A book that contains the instruction about a old 
   treasure chamber in the mountains over Verge. The treasure chamber belongs to 
   a long dead adventurer. In fact the baron doesn`t even know he has the 
   book. But it lies somewhere between all his books. You see, he has a private 
   library. The pcs will be attacked one hour from the place they found
   (walking)the dead man. Dmitri plans to attack Verge tomorrow at sunrise.

   If the soldiers, Max and Tom can't capture the pcs ths time they will try to later with
   the double amount of men (20 stk.) The reason why Dmitri wants to capture the pcs 
   is that he knows that he knows that a group of adventurers could easely grow to a problem.
   Tom and Max have 1 1/2 healing poisons each. When the pcs finally get captured (try to get 
   them captured) they will be taken to Dmitris camp. (All the weapons on the pcs will 
   offcourse be removed.) All his army is there. As soon as they 
   are in the camp they will be taken to Dmitri himself. He wants to chopp the heads of the pcs 
   just for the fun. Then he will get a possible threat away. Dmitri stands in the middle of 
   the camp when the pcs are brought to him. He is tall, dark and strong.When the pcs get to 
   him read this:
 

   "You see a man in the middle of the camp. He is dark and tall with black hair and black eyes.
   His black field plate armor shines in the sun. He shouts out a name in a dialect and language 
   you have never heard before. And a fat man comes out of one of the tents nearby. 
   He carries an axe in his right hand. He looks at this tall dark man with these black terrible 
   eyes and says a sentence impossible to understand cause of the rare language he speakes. 
   The tall dark man points at you and grunts like an orc. The fat man walks towards you. 
   He lifts his axe over his head and is about to hit you with it when you all suddenly hear a 
   scream of hundreds of men and horses running over the ground. The ground shakes lightly and 
   you hear heavy bodies hit the ground. Screams of dying men fill the air. The fat man suddenly 
   falls around and hits the ground. An arrow hit him through the back and deep into his heart. 
   The tall dark man pulles up his sword and runs into the fight. A smell of blood is in the air 
   and you see the tents lit by the attackers. Someone made an attack on the camp. But who?"  

 From here its your job to make the adventure. And remember: the adventure is supposed to 
 match the heading. See Rules on the main page.
