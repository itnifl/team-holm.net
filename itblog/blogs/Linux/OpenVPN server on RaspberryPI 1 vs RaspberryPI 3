  <p class="smaller">-1st of November 2017<br/></p>
  This article will briefly describe an experiment with performance on a Open VPN server running on Raspberry PI 1 vs running on Raspberry PI 3. Both hardware units are running Raspbian as the operating system.<br /><br />
  <b>Note: </b><i>D:\</i><b> represents the command prompt and is not actually a part of the commands shown below.</b><br/>

        <b>Before we start the following needs to be summarized:</b><br />
        <ul>
          <li>The available download speed as seen from the OpenVPN router is 80 Mbps</li>
          <li>The available upload speed as seen from the OpenVPN router is 30 Mbps</li>
          <li>How to set up a OpenVPN server will not be described here. </li>
          <li>The OpenVPN server / client is not set up to compress and decompress traffic as this will load the CPU on the OpenVPN server more than I trust it to.</li>
          <li>There is only one client at a time in this scenario.</li>
        </ul>
        There are essentially two OpenVPN servers set up, one one RaspeberryPI 1 and one on RaspberryPI 3. They both route to the same network where the same
        Windows 10 machine is running a server instance of iperf3. It can be started like so:
        <pre class="brush: bash">
          iperf3.exe -s
        </pre>
        <br/>
        After the Iperf3 server process is startet at the Windows 10 machine, I will connect to the network remotely from a remote location in a neighboring city via OpenVPN, first using the Raspberry PI 1 based Open VPN router, then using the Raspberry PI 3 based Open VPN router.
        Each time I run iperf3 as a client from my VPN klient, connecting to the iperf3 server through the given OpenVPN server at the time and measuring the network throughput I get.<br />
        <br />
        So, lets start by connecting through Raspberry PI 1 first, then Raspberry PI 3.
