To create a report over all VDI users last login and reconnect time, you can use the following correlated query against the ViewEvent database of the VDI environment. This might be useful
if you are trying to get an overview of actual VDI usage in case they are still left running and not used/re-used.

<h4>The SQL query for the VDI report:</h4>
<p>
	<p class="smaller">
		<pre class="brush: sql">
		SELECT a.[ModuleAndEventText]
			  ,a.[Time]
			  ,a.[EventType]
			  ,a.[Source]     
			  ,a.[Severity]
			  ,a.[Node]
			  ,a.[UserSID]
			  ,a.[DesktopId]
			  ,a.[MachineId]
			  FROM [ViewEvent].[dbo].[VE_event] AS a
		WHERE a.[Time] =
			  (SELECT MAX(b.[Time]) FROM [ViewEvent].[dbo].[VE_event] AS b WHERE b.[ModuleAndEventText] = a.[ModuleAndEventText])
		AND
			  (a.[EventType] = 'BROKER_USERLOGGEDIN' OR a.[EventType] = 'AGENT_RECONNECTED')
		ORDER BY a.[ModuleAndEventText], a.[Time];</pre>
	</p>
	<br/>
	After this query is executed, the result can be copied and pasted into an excel spreadsheet, and in turn formatted nicely for presentation.
